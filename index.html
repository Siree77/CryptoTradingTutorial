                    <p>Here are some strategies tailored for traders starting with limited funds:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Choose Low-Fee Platforms:</strong> Opt for exchanges like Binance, which offer low transaction fees, to maximize your limited capital.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trade in Fractional Shares of Cryptocurrencies:</strong> You don't need to buy whole units of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, invest in smaller fractions to diversify your holdings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on Stablecoins:</strong> While starting with small amounts, consider trading stablecoins like USDT or USDC, which are less volatile than other cryptocurrencies.</li>
                    </ul>
